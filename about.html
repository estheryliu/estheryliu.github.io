		<h2>Hi! My name is Esther (she/her/hers). </h2>
		<p>Hi! It's me, Esther (she/her/hers). If you can't find me watercoloring or playing my oboe, catch me outside admiring a koi pond.</p>
		<p>I am currently a third year student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My fields of study are Communication and Music. I am also pursuing the Multimedia track under the Professional Writing Minor.</p>
		<p>Though a bit of a stationery addict, I take great pride in all the mini crafting endeavors I experiment with. Translating a variety of artistic skills through numerous solo and collaborative projects, I'm looking to apply myself in the visual communications and marketing field.</p>		
		<p>This site serves as my online portfolio, hosting a collection of writing and design samples. Please feel free to poke around and share your thoughts with me below!</p>
